This demo is intended to show the most basic DiCE setup. Skyboxes are not stereoscopic and so 
suck for VR, please do not judge DiCE based on this. 

Use 'T' to toggle DiCE on/off, then 'E'  to switch which curve is used for which eye, 
'Up' & 'Down' to toggle the DiCE intensity level (lowest is default), and 'R' & 'F' to 
fade DiCE in or out.
